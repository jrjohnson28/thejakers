There's a lot of buzz today in both marketing. We want simple design, clean and crisp. In an age where life is becoming increasingly convoluted, where work and play no longer have clean lines, where information comes like a flood with no discernible classification of importance, where the breadth of our relationships dwarfs the depth, we value simple more and more in our design and experiences.

At its best, simplicity distills something down to its true essence. Something that's successfully simple boils down an object to the point that it provides exactly what is needed to be enjoyed or function at its optimal level—and not an iota further.

Apple has generally been the flagship example of mastery of simplicity. Their products are clean, beautiful, functional, and intuitive. My iPhone gives me what I need, makes my life easier, and, well, just works.

Microsoft Outlook, on the other hand, is often maligned as having too many features for its own good. In trying to be all things to all people, it becomes nothing.

Whenever you try to simplify a product or an organization, the danger is that you can actually obliterate the essence of the the product or organization in the process. When the essence of a product or organization is obliterated you move from creating to pandering, you surrender to the demands of consumption, sacrificing the integrity of the object to the insatiable appetites of the subject, the consumer.

For instance, I find formulaic, supermarket fiction to be an obliteration of the craft of writing. Consumers demand distraction and new stories, they devour them in La-Z-Boys in off hours while watching the news. The book, while enjoyed is not the point, it is the consumer.

And there is nothing wrong with this. It fulfills a need in society. For all the railing writers do against this type of novel, the reality is that the supermarket trash fiction never assumed to be anything else other than what it is. In a sense, it is distilled down to its true essence—cheap, easily-read, consumable words arranged in a never-deviating, formulaic way.

We shouldn't complain about this. However, we should complain when something that was never intended to be dumbed down, something with a history, an original intent, is bastardized in order to satisfy the demands of the consumer. A recent example in books might be the removal of a particularly offensive racial slur from a new edition Mark Twain's <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which has sparked a huge controversy.

Another (much less controversial) example that I came across is the recent repackaging of Seattle's Best Coffee (SBC).

SBC, a long-time craft coffee company, has a long history of serving coffee in the traditional way, offering blends and varietals from various regions of the world.

The new packaging for SBC is more than just an ugly design, it is a complete transformation of the way its existing customer base interacts with the brand.

As <em>Communication Arts </em>writes:

> Seattle’s Best Coffee, part of Starbucks Corporation, recently launched Level System, a radically simplified premium packaged coffee line with expanded blend offerings and an innovative packaging concept. Designed by Seattle-based brand agency Creature, the packaging is labeled with vivid numbers and colors that tell consumers exactly what they want to know: which type of coffee fits their taste profile. With the new system, consumers will be able to easily find and choose from a selection of blends that span the entire range of coffee enjoyment, from a mild, light, crisp Level 1 to a bold, dark and intense Level 5. In addition to Levels 1 through 5, consumers can choose from a decaffeinated blend, an Organic Fair Trade Certified blend and Cinnamon (C) and Hazelnut (H) flavors. The new Level System lineup began replacing the existing Seattle’s Best Coffee products on shelves in December.

In "radically" simplifying their packaging, SBC has actually destroyed the essence of their product. They've distilled the object of coffee down to nearly nothing and sacrificed it on the alter of consumption.

This wouldn't be a problem except for the fact that the brand was built by a particular customer base that identifies with a craft coffee company that set itself apart from generic coffee by giving integrity to the product, by making (however slight) the product something more than just a cup of caffeine and a flavor profile.

What was once Sumatra is now 4. And that's just not right.

As a brand managers, creatives, and communications professionals, we must always be cognizant of our customers—and of the heritage of our products. We don't create in a vacuum. We must respect the road behind us while innovating as we move forward.

In our quest to simplify, we must never obliterate. Work to distill down to essence and no further, you'll be blessed with a true product instead of horridly colored, number-systemed, coffee bags.
