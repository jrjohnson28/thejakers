#Writer, creative director...and a bunch of other stuff too

I'm a creative utility player. I've been a founding agency partner, chief copywriter, creative director, book editor, managing director, content strategist, communications director, project manager, and barista (of course).

Over the years, I've worked with a lot of big companies—you know, like Fortune 5 and up—and a lot of small ones too.

I'm currently the Sr. Managing Editor at (link: infusionsoft.com text: Infusionsoft), where I work everyday with an amazing team to help small businesses succeed.
