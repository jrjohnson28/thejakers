Over the years, I’ve learned from my kids that one of the most powerful questions is, “Why?”

When you believe in something strongly, ask, “Why?”

When someone disagrees with you, ask, “Why?”

When you buck against authority, ask, “Why?”

When people exercise authority over you, ask, “Why?”

When you disagree with someone, ask, “Why?”

When things are going well, ask, “Why?”

When things are going poorly, ask, “Why?”

When you succeed, ask, “Why?”

When you fail, ask, “Why?”

In all things, ask, “Why?”

Why? It will save you a lot of pain and teach you a lot of lessons.

Don’t agree? Why?
