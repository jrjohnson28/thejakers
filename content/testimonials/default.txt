###Below are just a few of the nice things folks have said about working with me.

“I’ve always believed that business is a team sport. And to succeed you need the best teammates you can find. Because of this I’ve never compromised when it came to selecting my partners. As a bestselling author-not writer-and a successful businessman, I need a writing partner who can help shape my ideas and make my books and articles shine. Jake is an invaluable asset to me and my business. There are very few people I’d trust my words to. Jake is at the top of that list.” 
***– Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad***

“Jake and his BAJI team accepted the challenge of developing our initial web presence for Aqwastream™. It was impressive how Jake directed his broad business experience into a laser-tight focus and created a sharp concept, spot-on copy and contemporary visuals to explain the WHY about our brand and business offering. We’ll be working with Jake and his team again, for sure.” 
***– Marian Van Dyke, Aqwastream CEO***

“In the fast-paced world of Online Advertising, Jake has been an amazing contact to have—he’s ready to go, ready to roll, and his copy goes over well with even the toughest of clients. We’ve worked on books, websites, SEO copy, social media, marketing copy and more—and one thing remains the same—his copy is fresh, creative, and impresses my clients, from Fortune 500 to local clientele. He’s great for a good laugh, too.”

“Jake is a master at both content strategy and in crafting the content itself. As a director, not only is he able to fulfill hard-to-meet deadlines inside of the hectic agency world, he’s able to do so while making sure his team is well cared for and operating at peak performance. Additionally, he hosts the best ‘open office hours.’ You should ask him about them sometime.” 
***– Perry Azevedo, Full stack developer and designer***

“Jake provides exemplary work by ghostwriting for published books and developing original content. Providing solutions both online, and offline, Jake brings a professional, trustworthy attitude to a given project. These timely projects are also affordable providing us with great value. At a time when everyone with access to a computer thinks they are a writer, Jake breaks away from the pack with a detailed knowledge of the subject.” 
***– Ryan Nalepinski, Creative Lead, The Rich Dad Company***

“Jake’s skill set as a literary artist, writer and editor are truly extraordinary. The only thing that supersedes Jakes skills is his character. He is a class act who says what he will do—and he delivers. Working with Jake was seamless and stretching because he aims to serve your needs and challenges you to be your very best. I recommend Jake Johnson without reservation.” 
***– Karl Clauson, Author and National Radio Host***

“Jake Johnson has the uncommon ability to quickly grasp and translate a complicated industry like teleradiology and communicate it as if he’s been in the business for years. Not only that but his talent for understanding our brand on short notice—and staying true to it—was invaluable. In the end, Jake delivered copy for our website that we loved—and right on deadline.”
